\textbf{To Reviewer \#1:}

\textcolor{blue}{Thanks for the comments for our paper, we have revised the manuscript according to your recommendations as follows:}

\textbf{Comment (1).} In this paper, The author raises a viewpoint that in the visual object tracking problem, humans present behavioral modes (eye movement) that differ from the bounding box of single object tracking. 
Therefore, the main purpose is to evaluate the behavioral output mode, not only the tracking performance. 
This part needs to adds more content to explain why the evaluation of the behavioral output mode is more important which means why we need to consider brain-like score. 
Because in visual object tracking problem, the problem is the accuracy of object tracking. 
The reason for considering the result of behavioral output mode is not adequate for the reviewer.
% 为什么用行为输出模式
% 更接近于人。使模型的输出更加接近于人的响应。

\textbf{Response:} \textcolor{blue}{Thank you for your valuable comment.
%Maybe we did not explain it clearly in the previous manuscript. 
In the revised version, we have reorganized the introduction of Brain-like Tracking Score, especially the behavioral metrics. 
The purpose of behavioral benchmarks it to compute the similarity between source (e.g., a DNN model) and target (e.g., human) behavioral responses. 
% 第二段
Even within the visual behavioral domain of core object recognition, there are many similar behavioral metrics.
They use the metric of image-by-image patterns of human behavior [1]. 
For core eye object tracking tasks, human exhibits behavioral patterns that differ from ground truth labels. 
For example, in pedestrians tracking, humans may pay more attention to the head or even the face, while the visual tracking task focuses on the body or even torso.
One consequence of this is that DNNs can achieve 100\% accuracy but will not gain a perfect behavioral and cortical similarity score.
Thus, we use both the behavioral response pattern metric and cortical metric, not an overall accuracy metric, and higher scores are obtained by DNNs that produce and predict the human patterns.
Finally, we have emphasized it in Section 5.1 as follows: 
}

% 5.1章 第一段
\textcolor{red}{
``The aim of behavioral metrics is to calculate the
similarity between the DNN outputs and the human behavioral outputs in a specific problem [9]. 
In the human eye object tracking, the subjects’s attention is a circle scope and related to human pupil.
Thus, the behavioral modes (the position of eye gaze and the size of pupil) is modeled as a circle and differs from the bounding box in visual object tracking. 
Meanwhile, the main purpose is to realize human-like intelligence, not only the tracking accuracy [36]; and BTN obtains better behavioral similarity and can predict the position and scope of eye gaze well. 
Otherwise, the result is that DNNs gain perfect bounding box fitting but can not obtain a good eye gaze prediction performance. "

\textbf{(2).} The paper says that the BTS may vary when the BTN is retrained. 
So only the given trained BTN is optimal. 
Does it means that the application of BTN is very limited according to its training dataset. 
How to improve the BTN so it could applied to the most conditions.

\textbf{Response:} \textcolor{blue}{Thank you for your comment. 
The old version elaborates unclearly in explaining the training of the BTN. 
In the revised manuscript, we have rewritten our description about the discussion to make it more understandable.
Since BTN is a transferable problem, architectures transfer well across tasks.
However, it cannot be precluded that the BTS may vary when using same network architectures and different training settings. 
It is useful to improve the transfer by retraining the DNN with optimized training configurations. 
Therefore, we believe that only the given trained BTN is optimal and not all types of network structure.
In the application of BTN, we can perform grid search to select the optimal training settings, such as learning rate and weight decay, based on a validation set.
We have emphasized it in Section 7.2 as follows:
}

% 7.2章 第二段
% 只是特定训练好的模型是效果最好的，而不是网络结构就行(重新训练就可能不是最好的了)
% 具体地应用中怎么训练模型（寻找最优的训练配置）
\textcolor{red}{
``Nevertheless, the independent training configuration may be the essential characteristic that trains the DNN [68]. In addition, an auxiliary task does not have a very large impact on the score but notably improves the transfer effect [68]. 
Because the BTN is a transferable problem, it cannot be precluded that the BTS may vary when using different training settings. 
They claim that it is useful to tremendously improve the transfer effect by retraining the DNN with optimized configurations [68].
Therefore, we believe that only the given trained
BTN is optimal and not all model of network architecture. 
Practically speaking, we can perform grid search to select the optimal training settings based on a validation set."

\textbf{(3).} The paper has raised a brain-like tracking network model to solve object tracking problem. 
But it appears that it contributes most to establish a neuroscience-like model rather than solving the object tracking problem. 
So is it necessary to use brain-like model to solve the object tracking problem than just using DNN?
% 不是主要解决SOT的问题：可解释的问题
% DNN的必要性，为什么不用其他 类脑模型。（复杂场景）

\textbf{Response:} \textcolor{blue}{Thanks for your professional suggestions. 
The goal of our work is mainly to solve the interpretability problem of visual tracking model and implement a brain-like architecture with both high accuracy and excellent brain similarity. 
In the revised manuscript, we have analysed the motivation of our work and the reason for using the brain-like model in our introduction as follows:
}

% TODO
% 第1章 第1段
\textcolor{red}{
``Amazingly, in
trained deep neural networks (DNNs) used to classify images [2], the middle layer in DNNs can partially explain why the nerve cell in the middle layer of the visual cortex has specific activations to an image [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. 
Furthermore, these models also partly predict primate image classification behavior and evaluations [9, 10].
Excellent models of the brain provide extraordinary opportunities for brain-computer interfaces, and these methods can be utilized to produce the expected activations in the cortical pathway [11]." 
} \\
% 第1章 第2段
\textcolor{red}{
``To capture cortical processing even more strictly
in these models, continued architectural search on
traditional visual datasets alone no longer seems
to be a feasible solution. 
Even though the great tracking performance in deeper DNNs has truly increased [12, 13], it is hopeless to raise the brain-like score [9, 14]. 
In addition, at the beginning, only partial modules can be obviously mapped to corresponding regions of the visual pathway, and the relations between the small number of visual regions and the numerous and complex modules in GoogleNet [15] or Inception-v4 [16] are inconspicuous. 
Finally, the network with high accuracy in the visual task becomes increasingly deeper except for several brain-like architectures for image classification [17, 18]."

\textbf{(4).} Another suggestion is that it will be better to introduce the structure of the paper in the introduction part.
This paper has very good potential. 
The reviewer believes it could be an outstanding paper after revision.

\textbf{Response:} \textcolor{blue}{Thanks for your valuable suggestions.
In the revised manuscript, we have introduced the structure of the paper in the tail of our introduction part as follows:
}

% 第1章 第3段
\textcolor{red}{
``To address the interpretability problem of visual tracking model, in this study, we propose that aligning DNNs to anatomy will result in shallower, more interpretable, and more brain-like tracking models, named brain-like tracking network (BTN). 
The BTN is a shallow recurrent brain-like architecture of the brain pathway; hence, it has a much more brain-like structure. In section 4, we introduce the method utilized to analyse human behavioral and cortical data during object tracking. In section 5, we build a fancy measurement method for predicting eye movement behavior and neural activations on the brain-like tracking score (BTS).
In our experiments, we introduce a new benchmark dataset composed of behavioral and cortical recordings, and present an outstanding tracking result of 36.5\% at evaluating the model similarity of the visual pathway while obtaining a good tracking effect in the Tracking-Gump dataset [19]. 
We find that these results are mainly due to the brain-like architecture, in accordance with prior knowledge of the human cortical pathway processing stimuli input [17, 20, 18]. 
Finally, to compare the model activations between the RNN MT/MST in the BTN and the responses in the human middle temporal and medial superior temporal areas (MT/MST), we discover that the BTN predicts these cortical activations well, and it is also the first visual tracking model to do so on the neural recordings."

\textbf{To Reviewer \#3:}

\textcolor{blue}{Thanks for the comments for our paper, we have revised the manuscript according to your recommendations as follows:}

\textbf{(1).}  The literature review is not thorough about the application and the contributions. 
To highlight the contributions, it suggests reorganizing the section of the related work. 
At least, for each contribution, it should be novel and meaningful according to a thorough literature review. 
In the literature analysis, it is recommended to read the following works and consider to discuss their similar application scenarios in the introduction and discussion,

\textbf{Response:}  \textcolor{blue}{Thank you for your kind suggestion.
The goal of our work is mainly to solve the interpretability problem of visual tracking model.
In the revised manuscript, we have reorganized the corresponding description of recurrent neural networks and related applications in the section of related work, and emphasized it as follows:} \\
% 2.1第二段
\textcolor{red}{
``To track a target, it seems to be very suitable to use recurrences and glimpses, but they have only been employed successfully in monochromatic videos with simple backgrounds [23]. 
Some [27] obtained prominent results through representations of the target detector that is the input of a recurrent neural network (RNN) [28].
However, it needs to process each full frame. 
A recent study [29] utilized an RNN cropping explicitly to build attention in humans. 
Our study is similar to [23, 30], and utilizes human attention which is implemented with a long short memory network (LSTM) to extract the movement features well in multiple frames. 
In addition, we seek to design a brain-like network that will gain a superior BTS and exceed the existing tracking models on the Tracking-Gump dataset [19]."
